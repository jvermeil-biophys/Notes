* Rheology of the active cell in mitosis, 2016
In this study, EFF performs compressions of HeLa cells in mitosis between parallel plates. With her coauthors, she develops a rheological model of the response, based on a relaxation spectrum with a maximum relaxation time T~10s. Mitotic HeLa cells where used for this study because being highly tensed cells, they adopt very conserved shapes as they are pressed between the two plates, which can be predicted from a simple adimensionnal shape parameter. The main quantitative measurements constisted in oscillatory cell compression, which were analyzed with a modidied power-law-rheology model. Briefly, instead of a normal power law model, which can be understood as an infinite number of Maxwell elements in parallel, each contributing to the relaxation spectrum of the material, the model proposed in this paper consider a maximum relaxation timescale, a "cutoff time" in the relaxation spectrum. This allow the authors to modelize the relaxation spectrum as a simple step-like function, and therefore obtain a kind of "modified-power-law rheological model". The fitted function is G2D(f) the relaxation modulus, which is time - or frequency dependant - (step response versus oscillatory forcing) as it synthetises all the single relaxation phenomenons happening in the material; spectrum amplitude K_h = 18.5mN/m, cutoff time tau_max = 12.8sec. From there the presented scalar parameters describing cortex mechanics is G2D(1Hz) = 80mN/m. When deducing from this parameter a bulk relaxation modulus, the value found was: G3D(1Hz) = G2D/(2(1+nu).d = 100kPa with d = 200nm. Using the same rheology measurement to compute a "whole cell storage modulus", the results were E'(1Hz) ~ 1.3kPa for mitotic cells and E' ~ 300Pa for interphase cells. The authors also explored the effect of MyosinII and crosslinker activity on the cortex rheology. While the MyosinII inhibitors reduced G2D" much more drastically than G2D', alpha-actinin inhibitors decreased both slightly. The proposed interpretation of this is that MyosinII motors "fluidize" the cortex much more than to passive crosslinkers.

(G(t) = Integral_tau{h(t).[exp(-t/tau)/tau].dtau} where h(t) is the relaxation spectrum. It's intuitively linked with infinite Maxwells, where the discrete expression is: G(t) = Sum_i{(hi/taui).exp(-t/taui)})
