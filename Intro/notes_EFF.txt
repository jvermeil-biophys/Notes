* Quantif of the cell tension and internal pressure generated by a single cell in mitosis, 2014
This paper consider compressions of rounded cells (HeLa arrested in mitosis or freshly trypsinised) by a wedged AFM and introduce a simple method to compute the hydrostatic pressure difference and the tension of the cell surface from the applied force F_AFM and a the rough geometry of the cell. More precisely, assuming circular symmetry of the cell shape and, pressure and tension are simply dependant of the contact zone radius, the equatorial radius of the cell, and of course the force applied by the AFM. <demonstration in my notebook, only a few lines>.
The authors measure a tension of ~0.17mN/m in interphase cells and ~1.6mN/m in mitotic cells, one order of magnitude higher. Not only this variation is expected from the traditionnal vision of mitosis, but also the values matches with other observations (Charras, Mitchison 2008, tension in blebbs ~0.13-0.9mN/m). Furthermore when inferring a Young modulus from these surface tensions by simply dividing them by a typical cortical thickness (200nm), we find ~1kPa for interphase cortex and ~10kPa for mitotic cortex. This is pretty much the range of values we find with the pincher !

* Rheology of the active cell in mitosis, 2016
In this study, EFF performs compressions of HeLa cells in mitosis between parallel plates. With her coauthors, she develops a rheological model of the response, based on a relaxation spectrum with a maximum relaxation time T~10s. Mitotic HeLa cells where used for this study because being highly tensed cells, they adopt very conserved shapes as they are pressed between the two plates, which can be predicted from a simple adimensionnal shape parameter. The main quantitative measurements constisted in oscillatory cell compression, which were analyzed with a modidied power-law-rheology model. Briefly, instead of a normal power law model, which can be understood as an infinite number of Maxwell elements in parallel, each contributing to the relaxation spectrum of the material, the model proposed in this paper consider a maximum relaxation timescale, a "cutoff time" in the relaxation spectrum. This allow the authors to modelize the relaxation spectrum as a simple step-like function, and therefore obtain a kind of "modified-power-law rheological model". The fitted function is G2D(f) the relaxation modulus, which is time - or frequency dependant - (step response versus oscillatory forcing) as it synthetises all the single relaxation phenomenons happening in the material; spectrum amplitude K_h = 18.5mN/m, cutoff time tau_max = 12.8sec. From there the presented scalar parameters describing cortex mechanics is G2D(1Hz) = 80mN/m. When deducing from this parameter a bulk relaxation modulus, the value found was: G3D(1Hz) = G2D/(2(1+nu).d = 100kPa with d = 200nm. Using the same rheology measurement to compute a "whole cell storage modulus", the results were E'(1Hz) ~ 1.3kPa for mitotic cells and E' ~ 300Pa for interphase cells. The authors also explored the effect of MyosinII and crosslinker activity on the cortex rheology. While the MyosinII inhibitors reduced G2D" much more drastically than G2D', alpha-actinin inhibitors decreased both slightly. The proposed interpretation of this is that MyosinII motors "fluidize" the cortex much more than to passive crosslinkers.

(G(t) = Integral_tau{h(t).[exp(-t/tau)/tau].dtau} where h(t) is the relaxation spectrum. It's intuitively linked with infinite Maxwells, where the discrete expression is: G(t) = Sum_i{(hi/taui).exp(-t/taui)})

* Poisson Ratio of the cell actin cortex, 2020
In this paper, experimental data (wedged AFM cell oscillatory compressions) are associated to a model in silico of cell mechanics to determine the Poisson ratio of the cell cortex (relying on the model developped in the 2016 paper). The measured Poisson ratio are found to vary with the frequency of the compression. This is intuitive for a porous material such as the cytoskeletton: at short timescale, the water cannot flow through the network and should make it incompressible, but at longer timescale this is no longer true. However this study presents the counter-intuitive finding that the Poisson actually decrease with the frequency, from v=0.48 at 0.1Hz to 0.34 at 1Hz and 0.17 at 10Hz. Is it due to the range of frequency considered ? Apparently this was observed in some soft glassy materials such as "Acrylic glass". Maybe something to do with the cross-linkers, but I don't get it.
